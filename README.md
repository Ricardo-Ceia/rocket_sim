# Rocket Simulation 
A simple and interactive rocket flight simulation implemented using HTML, JavaScript, and Python. This project demonstrates the principles of rocket motion under the influence of gravity, based on the general law of gravitation.
## Key Features
- **Physics-Based Simulation:** Simulates rocket flight dynamics without considering air resistance, focusing purely on gravitational forces.
- **Real-Time Communication:** Utilizes the **WebSocket protocol** to establish seamless communication between the backend simulation (Python) and the frontend renderer (JavaScript).
- **Dynamic Visualization:** The rocket's motion and altitude are rendered in real-time within the browser.
